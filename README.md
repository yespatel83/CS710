# CS710

The info graphic above visualizes Global Coronavirus Deaths, Cases & Vaccinations using the publically available COVID-19 data here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/latest/owid-covid-latest.csv

All four of the visuals were created in R using the script: **"Patel_710_final_visualization_code.R"**

The R script above can be used to reproduce the data driven elements of all four plots presented in the infographic. 
To reproduce all figures the script should be run in its entirety from beginning to end.
